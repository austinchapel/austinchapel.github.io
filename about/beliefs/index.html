  Our beliefs come from a long tradition of studying the Bible combined with
  the transformation God has created in our lives. We believe the scriptures
  are a tremendous gift from God that help us understand his character more. We
  take that gift seriously by applying the fullness of our God-granted
  intellects towards internalizing, absorbing, and applying His truth in our
  lives.

    perfect in all ways. He then was crucified and rose from the dead on the
    third day.

- summary: The Holy Spirit empowers the church with all spiritual gifts.

- full: >
    Baptism and the Lordâ€™s Supper are both sacraments that have been practiced
    by Christians since the time of the Apostles. Baptism exists as a sign to
    show the world personal faith in Christ. Out of obedience to His command,
    we get baptized as a symbol to show our death with Christ and our new life
    in Christ. Likewise, the Lordâ€™s Supper, which was in-stated by Christ by
    the breaking of bread and partaking of wine, is practiced to remember the
    Lord, and what He did for us in His death on the Cross. Believers should
    frequently practice the Lordâ€™s Supper as a reminder of the beauty and glory
    of the gospel.

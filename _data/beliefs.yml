- summary: The Bible is the word of God.
  full: >
    We believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are true,
    authoritative, divinely inspired and without error. Men were moved by the
    Spirit of God to write the very words of Scripture. God gave scripture to
    man for guidance, and it is the final authority on all matters concerning
    life and faith.

    We believe Jesus is the eternal Son of God. Born of the virgin Mary Jesus
    lived as fully man and fully God. He is the exact imprint of God's nature,
    perfect and sinless. Jesus was crucified for the sin of the world and rose
    from the dead on the third day defeating sin and death.

    We believe the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity and is
    equally God. The Holy Spirit regenerates and indwells every believer as an
    assurance of our salvation, convicts the world of sin, points humanity
    towards Christ, intercedes for the saints, illuminates Scripture, helps in
    our weakness, and gives the believer spiritual gifts to minister.

    When tempted by the Serpent (Lucifer), Adam and Eve disobeyed God and
    brought sin into this world. Because of this, all humanity has been born
    into a sinful world, slaves of sin. God, being just and holy, must punish
    sin. The punishment for sin is death and eternity in hell.

    We believe that salvation from sin and death is through faith in Christ
    alone. The blood of Jesus Christ shed on the cross provides the only way
    for forgiveness of sin and his resurrection on the third day the only way
    to eternal life. God freely offers salvation and eternal life to all who
    believe and profess Christ as their Lord and Savior.

    being transformed to be more and more like Christ. We are his witnesses to
    the world and serve Him with good works and spreading the good news.

- summary: In the practice of Baptism and the Lord's Supper.
  full: >
    Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are both sacraments that have been practiced
    by Christians since the time of the Apostles. Baptism exists as a sign to
    display faith in Christ publicly. Out of obedience to His command, we get
    baptized as a symbol of our death with Christ and our new life in Christ.
    Likewise, the Lord’s Supper, which was instituted by Christ by the breaking
    of bread and partaking of wine, is practiced to remember His sacrifice on
    the Cross. Believers should frequently practice the Lord’s Supper as a
    reminder of the beauty and glory of the gospel.

    Jesus ascended into heaven after his resurrection and is creating a new
    home for us. He will one day return to glorify his church in the
    resurrection unto eternal life, establish His Kingdom, and judge those who
    reject His saving work. We believe that our eternal destination of either
    heaven or hell is determined by our response to the Lord Jesus Christ.

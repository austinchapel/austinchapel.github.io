- summary: The Bible is the word of God.
  full: >
    The Scriptures (66 books of the old and new Testaments) are true,
    authoritative and divinely inspired by God while penned by men. The
    Scriptures are complete and are not to be added to or taken from. They are
    given to us to better know God’s eternal plan and story and to grow in
    relationship with Him.
- summary: There is one true God who exists in three persons.
  full: >
    There is only one true and eternal God who is Creator and Ruler of all. He
    is one in essence and exists in three distinct persons Father, Son and Holy
    Spirit. God is one in nature and essence but three in works and substance.
- summary: Jesus is God, creator, and our savior.
  full: >
    Jesus is God and has existed eternally as the Son of God. Jesus is the
    creator and holds all things together with divine power and is worthy of
    all praise and glory. Just over two thousand years ago Jesus came to earth
    as a man. Born of the virgin Mary, He lived on earth and existed as fully
    man and fully God. He lived as the exact imprint of God's nature being
    perfect in all ways. He then was crucified and rose from the dead on the
    third day.
- summary: The Holy Spirit is God and dwells in the believer.
  full: >
    The Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity and is equally God. The
    Holy Spirit has eternally existed like the Father and Son and lives in all
    believers as an assurance of our salvation in Christ. The Holy Spirit
    convicts the world of sin and points humanity towards Jesus. The Holy
    Spirit also intercedes for the saints, illuminates Scripture, helps in our
    weakness, and gives the believer spiritual gifts to minister.
- summary: God created all from nothing.
  full: >
    God created the heavens and the earth from nothing as told in Genesis.
    Creation was a creative act of God and not a random process. He created all
    as part of His will and for His glory.
- summary: Lucifer rebelled and was cast out of heaven.
  full: >
    God created Angels to be spiritual worshippers in heaven. They have there
    own personal identities and role in God’s creation. Lucifer was an angel
    who desired to be like God. He and one third of the angels rebelled against
    God and were cast out of Heaven. Lucifer and the fallen angels are enemies
    of God and the Church.
- summary: God created humans in His image.
  full: >
    God created man with a purpose and for relationship with Him. From the
    beginning, mankind has had the responsibility to rule and take care of the
    world, as well to obey God and love Him. Man was created to give God glory
    and be worshippers of Him.
- summary: Sin entered the world through Adam's disobedience.
  full: >
    When tempted by Lucifer, Adam and Eve disobeyed God and brought sin into
    this world. By this, all of mankind has been born into a sinful world,
    slaves to sin, both because of the inherited Sin of Adam and because of our
    own personal decisions to sin. God, being just and holy, must punish sin.
- summary: Jesus came to earth being born of a virgin.
- summary: Jesus lived a perfect life to be the perfect sacrifice.
  full: >
    Jesus came to the earth to live a perfect life worthy to be a perfect
    sacrifice for sin. Jesus, at the end of His perfect life on earth, was
    crucified for all of mankind's sin. Our sins were put upon Christ and
    anyone who believes will receive salvation and be rid of the penalty of
    sin, which is death. Through Christ's death and resurrection on the third
    day we can receive eternal life and enter relationship with God.
- summary: Jesus was crucified for the sins of the World.
- summary: Jesus rose on the third day, conquering sin and death.
- summary: The church are those who have accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior.
  full: >
    The Church is made up of those who have accepted the gospel. We exist to
    glorify God with Christ as our center and leader. We have been saved by his
    grace and mercy and are eternally grateful. We serve Him out of
    thankfulness for all that he has done for us. Through the power of the Holy
    Spirit living in us, we are being transformed to be more and more Christ
    like. We are his witnesses to the world and serve him and invite others to
    do so as well.
- summary: The Holy Spirit empowers the church with all spiritual gifts.
- summary: Jesus will one day return in glory with all power.
  full: >
    Jesus ascended to heaven after his resurrection and is creating a new home
    for us. He will one day return to glorify his church, establish His Kingdom
    and to punish those who reject His saving work.

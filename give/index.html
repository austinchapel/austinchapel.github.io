    We establish a regular pattern of giving back to God not only because His
    word commands us to do so, but also because giving reminds us that what we

    Give, and it will be given to you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken
    together, running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you
    use it will be measured back to you.

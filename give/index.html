  We know that the material things we have on Earth belong to God. He has made
  us stewards of these things, but only for a time. We enjoy the opportunity to
  obey God by sharing those gifts with others.

    We establish a regular pattern of giving back to God not only because His
    word commands us to do so, but also because giving reminds us that what we
    have is not ours.

    Give, and it will be given to you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken
    together, running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you
    use it will be measured back to you.

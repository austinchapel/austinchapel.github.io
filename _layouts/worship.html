    Worship is anything we say or do to communicate that God is worthy of
    everything we have. Life is busy, so we gather regularly to spend time
    focusing on Him and elevating Him above all else in our lives.

      Don't let your life give evidence against your tongue. Sing with your
      voices &mdash; sing also with your hearts; sing with your mouths &mdash;
      sing also with your conduct.
